# SchoolDatabase

Project3 was a final project for a Java course at the University of Central Florida.
The project structure and code was developed by me. Being the project lead, I handled the majority of the coding such as the array search, exception handling while the structural code such as the getters and setters were assisted by my peers.
This project was a baseline for the entire class as it incorporated all the fundamental Java features such as classes, inheritence, overrides, exception handling, etc.

This project can very well be imlpemented into a fully fledged database system application with simple GUI elements, saving database information locally and exporting database information.
