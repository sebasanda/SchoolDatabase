# SchoolDatabase

Project3 was a final project for a Java course.
The project structure was developed by me, and the filler code such as the getters and setters were assisted by my peers.
This project was a baseline for the entire class as it incorporated all the fundamental Java features such as classes, inheritence, overrides, exception handling, etc.

This project can very well be imlpemented into a fully fledged database system application with simple GUI elements, saving database information locally and exporting database information.
